                Installed on the majority of computers worldwide, Comic Sans saw widespread use. Within four years of its release on Windows, designers had begun to argue that it had become overused, often through use in serious and formal documents in which it could appear too informal or even as inappropriate and disrespectful. The font is nonetheless very popular with educational users, up to high school level, with some schools in the United Kingdom requiring it in their style guides. Some have even imposed monitoring to make sure that it is used enough as part of their good teaching checklists.  </p>

                Times New Roman is a serif typeface designed for legibility in body text. It was commissioned by the British newspaper The Times in 1931 and conceived by Stanley Morison, the artistic advisor to the British branch of the printing equipment company Monotype, in collaboration with Victor Lardent, a lettering artist in the Times' advertising department. Although no longer used by The Times, Times New Roman is still very common in book and general printing. It has become one of the most popular and influential typefaces in history and a standard typeface on most desktop computers.</p>
